I made this program for my final project

The project structure and code are still very messy because I'm chasing deadlines for this and doing other work. I'm stupid when I'm in college I don't really care about my lectures I always do other things outside of my lectures. Now I realize how valuable time is for every task I get.

from now on I want to manage my time well and improve myself so that I can be disciplined and also consistent with what I want and what I do.

by the way thanks for reading my useless short story.
